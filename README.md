# 🧡 The Beacon  
## An RSS Reader for the Open Web Renaissance  
*A sidequest of [Worklight](https://github.com/your-worklight-link)*

> “Follow the signal. Shine your light.”

---

### 📖 Overview

**The Beacon** is a minimal, modern RSS feed reader built as part of the Worklight initiative. It’s designed to help contributors tune into distributed activity across the open web — from blogs to bots, GitHub to WordPress, and beyond.

By starting with a humble RSS reader, we’re laying the foundation for a future of interoperable presence, visibility, and collaboration tooling.

---

### 🔦 Why Build This?

- RSS is one of the oldest, most resilient tools of the web.
- Most modern collaboration happens in silos (Discord, Twitter, Slack).
- We believe contributors deserve a **clearer signal**.
- The Beacon helps us visualize work across protocols — beginning with RSS.

---

### 🚧 MVP Features

- [ ] Accept a list of RSS feed URLs
- [ ] Periodically fetch and parse feed entries
- [ ] Display items in a clean reverse-chronological timeline
- [ ] Group entries by source, tag, or person
- [ ] Normalize items into a **Worklight Feed Schema**
- [ ] Optional: Export feed to JSON or shareable HTML

---

### 🧱 Tech Stack (tentative)

- **Backend**: Node.js (feed fetcher + parser)
- **Parser**: `rss-parser` or `feedparser`
- **Frontend**: Astro or React (light UI for displaying the feed)
- **Storage**: In-memory or local JSON files (for now)

### 🧪 Getting Started

> Coming soon — we’ll scaffold this once the repo is initialized.

### 🧠 Inspiration + Influence

- Dave Winer’s [WordLand](http://scripting.com/)
- RSS 2.0 and Atom
- IndieWeb, Scuttlebutt, ActivityPub
- Worklight project vision: presence, tension, attention, and signal aggregation

### 🌊 Visual Metaphor

> RSS is the **lighthouse** of the open web.  
> The Beacon listens, watches, and reveals.  
> Worklight is the ship — and the crew.
