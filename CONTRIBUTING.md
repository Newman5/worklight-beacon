# Contributing to The Beacon

Thanks for your interest in contributing! The Beacon is a sidequest of the Worklight project, aiming to build open web tools for contributor visibility and interop.

We welcome:
- 🛠️ Code contributions
- 📄 Documentation improvements
- 🧪 Test cases and examples
- 💡 Ideas for features or protocol integrations

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repo
2. Clone your fork locally
3. Install dependencies:
```bash
   npm install
```
    Run the CLI:
```bash
    npm start
```
Submitting Changes

    Open a branch: git checkout -b feature/my-feature-name

    Make your changes

    Write/update tests if needed

    Commit and push: 
```bash
git commit -m "Add my feature" → git push origin
```
    Open a pull request

Code Style

    - TypeScript

    - Keep it modular (each utility in its own file)

    - Use meaningful commit messages

    - Follow the spirit of Worklight: simple, readable, interoperable

Thanks again for helping build tools the open web deserves. 🧡
